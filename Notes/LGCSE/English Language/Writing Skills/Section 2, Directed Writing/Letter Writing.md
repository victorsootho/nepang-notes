### Section 2: Directed Writing

#### Letter Writing

Letter writing is a valuable skill that requires understanding different formats and tones based on the context and the recipient. Letters can be classified into three main categories: informal, semi-formal, and formal. Each type of letter has a distinct format, content, and appropriate endings. Mastering these variations will enable you to communicate effectively in various situations.

#### Informal Letters

Informal letters are written to friends, family members, and close acquaintances. The tone is casual and conversational, and the content often includes personal news, updates, and anecdotes.

1. **Format**
   - **Sender’s Address**: Place the sender’s address at the top right corner of the page.
   - **Date**: Write the date below the sender’s address.
   - **Salutation**: Use casual greetings such as "Dear [First Name]," or simply "Hi [First Name],".
   - **Body**: Write in a conversational tone, sharing personal news, stories, or asking about the recipient’s well-being. Use paragraphs to separate different topics.
   - **Closing**: Use informal closings like "Yours," "Love," "Best wishes," or "Take care," followed by your first name.

   **Example:**

   Dear Emma,

   I hope this letter finds you well. It's been a while since we last caught up, and I have so much to tell you! Last weekend, I went hiking in the mountains, and it was an incredible experience. The views were breathtaking, and I even managed to capture some amazing photos. How have you been? Any exciting news to share?

   Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

   Love,
   Sarah

#### Semi-Formal Letters

Semi-formal letters are written to acquaintances, colleagues, teachers, or officials you know personally but are not close friends with. The tone is polite and respectful, balancing formality and friendliness.

1. **Format**

   - **Date**: Write the date below the sender’s address.
   - **Salutation**: Use respectful greetings such as "Dear [Title] [Last Name],".
   - **Body**: Maintain a polite tone, clearly stating the purpose of the letter. Organize the content into paragraphs, each focusing on a specific point or topic.
   - **Closing**: Use polite closings like "Yours sincerely," "Best regards," or "Kind regards," followed by your full name.

   **Example:**
