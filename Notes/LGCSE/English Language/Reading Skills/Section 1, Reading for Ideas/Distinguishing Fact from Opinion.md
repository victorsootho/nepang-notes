#### **Critical Thinking Questions:**

1. **Why is it important to distinguish between facts and opinions in academic writing?**

4. **How might cultural differences influence what is considered fact versus opinion?**
   - Cultural differences can affect interpretations of facts and opinions, as cultural contexts and values shape how information is perceived and evaluated.

#### **Conclusion:**

Mastering the ability to distinguish between facts and opinions is essential for academic success and informed decision-making. By carefully analyzing language, seeking evidence, and understanding biases, 12th-grade students can improve their critical thinking and communication skills. Both facts and opinions play important roles in discourse, but recognizing the difference is key to effective analysis and clear expression.
