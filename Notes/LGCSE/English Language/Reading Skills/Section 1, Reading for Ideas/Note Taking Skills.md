**How it works:**
- **Setup:** Divide your paper into three sections: a narrow left column, a wide right column, and a bottom section.
- **During the Lecture or Reading:**
  - Record main ideas, key points, and supporting details in the right column.

**Benefits:**

This method organizes information hierarchically, making it easier to understand relationships between main ideas and details.

**How it works:**
- **Setup:** Write main topics or headings on the far left of the page.

#### **3. The Mind Mapping Method**

Mind mapping uses diagrams to visually represent ideas and their connections.
