### Basic Operations

In mathematics, mastering the use of basic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—is crucial for performing calculations accurately. This section will cover the application of these operations with whole numbers, decimal fractions, vulgar (and mixed) fractions, and directed numbers. Emphasis will be placed on the correct ordering of operations and the use of brackets.

#### Operations with Whole Numbers

**Addition (+)**: Combining two or more quantities.
- Example: $5 + 3 = 8$

**Subtraction (−)**: Finding the difference between two quantities.
- Example: $9 - 4 = 5$

**Multiplication (×)**: Repeated addition of a number.
- Example: $6 × 3 = 18$

**Division (÷)**: Splitting a quantity into equal parts.
- Example: $12 ÷ 4 = 3$

#### Operations with Decimal Fractions

**Addition and Subtraction**: Align the decimal points and perform the operation as with whole numbers.
- Example: $4.5 + 3.75 = 8.25$
- Example: $7.8 - 2.5 = 5.3$

**Multiplication**: Multiply as with whole numbers, then place the decimal point in the product.
- Example: $2.5 × 1.2 = 3.0$

**Division**: Move the decimal point to convert the divisor to a whole number, then divide.
- Example: $6.3 ÷ 0.3 = 21$

#### Operations with Vulgar (and Mixed) Fractions

**Addition and Subtraction**: Convert fractions to a common denominator before performing the operation.
- Example: $\frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{8}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{11}{12}$
- Example: $\frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{3}{6} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

**Multiplication**: Multiply the numerators and denominators directly.
- Example: $\frac{3}{4} × \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3 × 2}{4 × 5} = \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10}$

**Division**: Invert (reciprocal) the divisor and multiply.
- Example: $\frac{2}{3} ÷ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} × \frac{5}{4} = \frac{10}{12} = \frac{5}{6}$

**Mixed Fractions**: Convert to improper fractions for operations.
- Example: $1 \frac{2}{3} + 2 \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{20}{12} + \frac{27}{12} = \frac{47}{12} = 3 \frac{11}{12}$

#### Operations with Directed Numbers

**Addition and Subtraction**: Pay attention to the signs.
- Example: $-3 + 5 = 2$
- Example: $7 - (-2) = 7 + 2 = 9$

**Multiplication and Division**: Follow the rules of signs.
- Positive × Positive = Positive
- Negative × Negative = Positive
- Positive × Negative = Negative
- Negative × Positive = Negative
- Example: $-4 × -3 = 12$
- Example: $-15 ÷ 3 = -5$

#### Order of Operations

To ensure calculations are performed correctly, adhere to the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS/BODMAS (Brackets, Indices/Orders (exponents), Division and Multiplication (left to right), Addition and Subtraction (left to right)).

1. **Brackets**: Perform operations inside brackets first.
2. **Indices (Orders)**: Calculate powers and roots.
3. **Division and Multiplication**: From left to right.
4. **Addition and Subtraction**: From left to right.

**Example 1:**

$$ 3 + 5 × 2 = 3 + 10 = 13 $$


**Example 2:**

$$ (4 + 3) × 2 = 7 × 2 = 14 $$


**Example 3:**

$$ 6 - 3 + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 $$


**Example 4:**

$$ 8 ÷ 2 × 3 = 4 × 3 = 12 $$


**Example 5:**

$$ 10 + (2 × (3 + 1)) = 10 + (2 × 4) = 10 + 8 = 18 $$


#### Use of Brackets

Brackets are used to override the standard order of operations, indicating which operations should be performed first. This is crucial in complex calculations to ensure clarity and accuracy.

**Example 6:**

$$ (2 + 3) × (4 - 1) = 5 × 3 = 15 $$


**Example 7:**

$$ 7 + [3 × (2 + 1)] = 7 + [3 × 3] = 7 + 9 = 16 $$


**Example 8:**

$$ 6 - (4 ÷ 2 + 1) = 6 - (2 + 1) = 6 - 3 = 3 $$


### Summary

By mastering basic operations with whole numbers, decimal fractions, vulgar (and mixed) fractions, and directed numbers, while adhering to the correct order of operations and the use of brackets, students can tackle a wide range of mathematical problems with confidence and precision.
