### Squares, Square Roots, Cubes, and Cube Roots

#### Squares of Numbers
The square of a number is the result of multiplying the number by itself. If \( n \) is a number, its square is written as \( n^2 \).

**Examples**:
- \( 4^2 = 4 \times 4 = 16 \)
- \( 7^2 = 7 \times 7 = 49 \)
- \( 10^2 = 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

#### Square Roots of Numbers
The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. It is denoted by the radical symbol \( \sqrt{} \).

**Examples**:
- \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \) because \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \)
- \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \) because \( 7 \times 7 = 49 \)
- \( \sqrt{100} = 10 \) because \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \)

#### Calculating Squares and Square Roots
1. **Using a Calculator**:
   - For squares, enter the number and use the square function \( x^2 \).
   - For square roots, enter the number and use the square root function \( \sqrt{x} \).

2. **Manually**:
   - **Square**: Multiply the number by itself.
   - **Square Root**: Identify the number whose square is the given number. For non-perfect squares, estimate or use long division method.

**Examples**:
- Manually calculating \( 6^2 \):
  \[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

- Estimating \( \sqrt{50} \):
  \[ \sqrt{50} \approx 7.07 \]
  (since \( 7 \times 7 = 49 \) and \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \), \( \sqrt{50} \) is between 7 and 8)

#### Cubes of Numbers
The cube of a number is the result of multiplying the number by itself twice. If \( n \) is a number, its cube is written as \( n^3 \).

**Examples**:
- \( 2^3 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \)
- \( 3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27 \)
- \( 5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \)

#### Cube Roots of Numbers
The cube root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself twice, gives the original number. It is denoted by the radical symbol \( \sqrt[3]{} \).

**Examples**:
- \( \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 \) because \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \)
- \( \sqrt[3]{27} = 3 \) because \( 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27 \)
- \( \sqrt[3]{125} = 5 \) because \( 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \)

#### Calculating Cubes and Cube Roots
1. **Using a Calculator**:
   - For cubes, enter the number and use the cube function \( x^3 \).
   - For cube roots, enter the number and use the cube root function \( \sqrt[3]{x} \).

2. **Manually**:
   - **Cube**: Multiply the number by itself twice.
   - **Cube Root**: Identify the number whose cube is the given number. For non-perfect cubes, estimate or use the approximation method.

**Examples**:
- Manually calculating \( 4^3 \):
  \[ 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 64 \]

- Estimating \( \sqrt[3]{50} \):
  \[ \sqrt[3]{50} \approx 3.68 \]
  (since \( 3^3 = 27 \) and \( 4^3 = 64 \), \( \sqrt[3]{50} \) is between 3 and 4)
