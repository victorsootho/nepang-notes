Sure, I'll provide a more detailed overview with examples only when they clarify key points.

### Vulgar and Decimal Fractions and Percentages

#### Understanding Fractions

**Vulgar Fractions**
- **Definition**: A vulgar fraction, or simple fraction, is expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ is the numerator and $b$ is the denominator.
- **Example**: $\frac{3}{5}$ indicates 3 out of 5 equal parts of a whole.

**Decimal Fractions**
- **Definition**: Decimal fractions represent fractions in the base 10 system, using a decimal point. For example, 0.75 represents three-quarters.
- **Conversion**: To convert a vulgar fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator.
  - **Example**: $\frac{7}{8} = 0.875$.

#### Percentages

**Definition**
- A percentage is a fraction out of 100, denoted by the percent symbol (%). For example, 45% means 45 out of 100.

**Conversions**
1. **Fraction to Percentage**: Multiply the fraction by 100.
   - **Example**: $\frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40\%$.

2. **Decimal to Percentage**: Multiply the decimal by 100.
   - **Example**: 0.58 $\times 100 = 58\%$.

3. **Percentage to Fraction**: Divide the percentage by 100 and simplify.
   - **Example**: 25% is $\frac{25}{100} = \frac{1}{4}$.

#### Applications

**Finance**
- **Interest Rates**: Often expressed as percentages to indicate annual or periodic rates.
  - **Example**: An interest rate of 5% on a savings account means you earn 5% of your balance annually.

- **Discounts**: Sale prices often include percentage discounts.
  - **Example**: A 20% discount on a $50 item means you save $10, so the discounted price is $40.

**Science and Engineering**
- **Concentrations**: Chemical solutions might be expressed in percentages.
  - **Example**: A solution with a 10% salt concentration means 10% of the solutionâ€™s weight is salt.

- **Efficiency Rates**: Machine performance is often measured in percentages.
  - **Example**: A machine with 80% efficiency means it performs at 80% of its maximum capacity.

**Everyday Life**
- **Recipes**: Ingredients can be measured in fractional amounts.
  - **Example**: A recipe requiring $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of sugar means you need three-quarters of a cup.

- **Measurements**: Precision in measurements is often given in decimal fractions.
  - **Example**: A length of 2.75 meters indicates 2 meters and 75 hundredths of a meter.

- **Exam Scores**: Performance is often reported as a percentage.
  - **Example**: Scoring 85 out of 100 on a test translates to 85%.

By focusing on these applications and conversions, you can effectively use fractions, decimals, and percentages in both academic and real-world scenarios.
