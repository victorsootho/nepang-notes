### Sets of Points in Three Dimensions

In three-dimensional geometry, sets of points can be described in various ways depending on the conditions they satisfy. Here are common types of sets of points in three dimensions:

#### 1. **Sphere**

**Definition**: A sphere is the set of all points in three-dimensional space that are at a fixed distance (radius) from a given point (the center).

**Equation**: 

$$ (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = r^2 $$

where $(a, b, c)$ is the center of the sphere and $r$ is the radius.

**Description**: All points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this equation lie on the surface of the sphere.

#### 2. **Plane**

**Definition**: A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in three-dimensional space.

**Equation**: 

$$ ax + by + cz = d $$

where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants that define the orientation of the plane, and $d$ is a constant.

**Description**: All points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this equation lie on the plane.

#### 3. **Cylinder**

**Definition**: A cylinder is the set of all points that are a fixed distance (radius) from a given line (the axis) in three-dimensional space.

**Equation** (for a cylinder with axis along the z-axis):

$$ (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r^2 $$

where $(a, b)$ is the center of the base of the cylinder and $r$ is the radius.

**Description**: All points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this equation lie on the surface of the cylinder.

#### 4. **Cone**

**Definition**: A cone is the set of all points that are at a fixed distance from a given point (the apex) and a given line (the axis) that passes through the apex.

**Equation** (for a cone with apex at the origin and axis along the z-axis):

$$ x^2 + y^2 = (kz)^2 $$

where $k$ is a constant that defines the slope of the cone.

**Description**: All points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy this equation lie on the surface of the cone.

#### 5. **Line**

**Definition**: A line in three dimensions is the set of all points that satisfy a linear relationship between the coordinates.

**Parametric Equations**: 

$$ x = x_0 + at $$


$$ y = y_0 + bt $$


$$ z = z_0 + ct $$

where $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a point on the line and $a, b, c$ are direction ratios of the line.

**Description**: All points $(x, y, z)$ that satisfy these equations lie on the line.

### Practice Problems

1. **Describe the set of points that are 5 units away from point $(1, 2, 3)$**.
   - **Solution**: This set of points forms a sphere with the equation $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 2)^2 + (z - 3)^2 = 25$.

2. **Describe the set of points that satisfy $2x + 3y - z = 7$**.
   - **Solution**: This set of points forms a plane in three-dimensional space.

3. **Describe the set of points that are 4 units away from the z-axis**.
   - **Solution**: This set of points forms a cylinder with the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 16$.

4. **Describe the set of points on a line passing through $(2, 3, 4)$ and parallel to the vector $\langle 1, -1, 2 \rangle$**.
   - **Solution**: The parametric equations for this line are $x = 2 + t$, $y = 3 - t$, $z = 4 + 2t$.

5. **Describe the set of points that are equidistant from the points $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$**.
   - **Solution**: This set of points forms a plane bisecting the line segment joining $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(0, 1, 0)$, with the equation $x = y$.

By understanding these sets of points in three dimensions, students can visualize and solve complex geometric problems more effectively.
