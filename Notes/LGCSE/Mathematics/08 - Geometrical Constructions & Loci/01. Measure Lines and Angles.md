### Geometrical Constructions & Loci

Understanding geometrical constructions and loci involves the precise measurement and drawing of lines and angles. This section will guide you through the fundamental concepts and techniques.

#### Measuring Lines and Angles

Accurate measurement is crucial in geometry, both for constructing shapes and for solving problems involving distances and angles. Here’s how to measure lines and angles using basic tools:

**Measuring Lines**

To measure the length of a line segment, use a ruler or a measuring tape:

1. **Align the ruler**: Place the zero mark of the ruler at one endpoint of the line segment.
2. **Read the measurement**: Look at the mark on the ruler that aligns with the other endpoint of the line segment. This mark indicates the length of the line segment.

**Measuring Angles**

To measure an angle, use a protractor:

1. **Place the protractor**: Align the midpoint of the protractor with the vertex of the angle.
2. **Align the baseline**: Ensure that one side of the angle aligns with the zero line of the protractor.
3. **Read the measurement**: Look at where the other side of the angle intersects the number scale on the protractor. This intersection gives you the measure of the angle in degrees.

#### Practical Examples

**Example 1: Measuring a Line Segment**

- Given a line segment AB.
- Place the ruler such that the zero mark is at point A.
- If point B aligns with the 5 cm mark on the ruler, the length of AB is 5 cm.

**Example 2: Measuring an Angle**

- Given an angle ∠XYZ.
- Place the midpoint of the protractor at point Y.
- Align the baseline of the protractor with line YX.
- If line YZ intersects the protractor at 60°, the measure of ∠XYZ is 60°.

#### Practice Problems

1. Measure the length of the line segment CD using a ruler.
2. Measure the angle ∠EFG using a protractor.

By mastering the use of a ruler and protractor, you can accurately measure and construct various geometric shapes, which is essential for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.
