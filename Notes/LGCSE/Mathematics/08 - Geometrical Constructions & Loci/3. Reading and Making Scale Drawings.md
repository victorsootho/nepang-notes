### Reading and Making Scale Drawings

Scale drawings are used to represent objects that are too large or too small to be drawn at actual size. Understanding how to read and create scale drawings is essential in fields such as architecture, engineering, and map reading.

#### Understanding Scale

**Scale** is the ratio of the drawing's dimensions to the actual dimensions of the object. For example, a scale of 1:50 means that 1 unit on the drawing represents 50 units in real life.

**Common Scales**:
- **1:100**: Often used in architectural plans, where 1 cm on the drawing represents 100 cm (1 meter) in reality.
- **1:50**: Used for detailed architectural drawings.
- **1:10**: Used for small objects or components.

#### Reading Scale Drawings

**Steps to Read a Scale Drawing**:

1. **Identify the Scale**: Check the scale mentioned on the drawing. It will be in the format of 1:50, 1:100, etc.
2. **Measure the Drawing**: Use a ruler to measure dimensions on the drawing.
3. **Calculate the Actual Size**: Multiply the measured dimension by the scale factor to find the actual size.

**Example**:
- If a room measures 4 cm on a drawing with a scale of 1:50, the actual length is $4 \, \text{cm} \times 50 = 200 \, \text{cm}$ or 2 meters.

#### Making Scale Drawings

**Steps to Create a Scale Drawing**:

1. **Choose an Appropriate Scale**: Select a scale that allows the entire object to fit on the drawing paper.
2. **Measure the Actual Object**: Take precise measurements of the object or space you want to draw.
3. **Calculate Scaled Dimensions**: Divide the actual measurements by the scale factor.
4. **Draw the Object to Scale**: Use the scaled dimensions to draw the object on paper accurately.

**Example**:
- To draw a 10-meter long wall on a 1:100 scale, the drawing length will be $\frac{10 \, \text{meters}}{100} = 0.1 \, \text{meters}$ or 10 cm.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Reading Scale Drawings**:
   - A park is represented on a map with a scale of 1:500. If a pathway on the map measures 8 cm, what is the actual length of the pathway?

   **Solution**: $8 \, \text{cm} \times 500 = 4000 \, \text{cm}$ or 40 meters.

2. **Creating Scale Drawings**:
   - Draw a 15-meter long bridge on a 1:200 scale.

   **Solution**: $\frac{15 \, \text{meters}}{200} = 0.075 \, \text{meters}$ or 7.5 cm.

3. **Converting Between Scales**:
   - A building's height is shown as 5 cm on a 1:100 scale drawing. If you were to redraw it on a 1:200 scale, what would be the new height on the drawing?

   **Solution**: The actual height is $5 \, \text{cm} \times 100 = 500 \, \text{cm}$. On a 1:200 scale, the new drawing height will be $\frac{500 \, \text{cm}}{200} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}$.

#### Tips for Accurate Scale Drawings

1. **Use a Scale Ruler**: A scale ruler is specifically designed for scale drawings and can simplify the process.
2. **Double-Check Measurements**: Ensure that all measurements are accurate before starting your drawing.
3. **Maintain Proportions**: All parts of the drawing should be scaled equally to maintain accurate proportions.

By mastering the ability to read and create scale drawings, students will be able to represent and interpret objects accurately, an essential skill in many practical applications.
