### Substituting Numbers for Words and Letters in Formulae

In algebra, variables are used to represent numbers in formulae. Substituting specific values for these variables allows us to evaluate expressions and solve equations. This process is fundamental in applying algebra to real-world problems and understanding mathematical relationships.

#### Understanding Substitution

**Substitution** is the process of replacing a variable with a given number. This is often done to find the value of an algebraic expression for specific values of its variables.

#### Steps for Substitution

1. **Identify the variables** in the formula.
2. **Determine the values** to substitute for the variables.
3. **Replace each variable** with its corresponding value.
4. **Simplify the expression** to find the result.

#### Example Problems

**Example 1: Basic Substitution**

Consider the formula for the area of a rectangle: $A = l \times w$

- If $l = 5$ meters and $w = 3$ meters, find the area $A$.
  - Solution: Substitute $l = 5$ and $w = 3$ into the formula:
    
$$
    A = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ square meters}
    $$


**Example 2: Substitution in an Algebraic Expression**

Evaluate the expression $2x + 3y$ when $x = 4$ and $y = 2$.

- Solution: Substitute $x = 4$ and $y = 2$ into the expression:
  
$$
  2x + 3y = 2(4) + 3(2) = 8 + 6 = 14
  $$


**Example 3: Substitution in a Quadratic Formula**

Consider the quadratic equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$. Find $y$ when $a = 2$, $b = -3$, $c = 1$, and $x = 2$.

- Solution: Substitute $a = 2$, $b = -3$, $c = 1$, and $x = 2$ into the equation:
  
$$
  y = 2(2)^2 - 3(2) + 1 = 2(4) - 6 + 1 = 8 - 6 + 1 = 3
  $$


**Example 4: Substitution in a Physics Formula**

The formula for calculating the force ($F$) is given by Newton's second law: $F = m \times a$

- If the mass ($m$) is 10 kg and the acceleration ($a$) is $9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2$, find the force $F$.
  - Solution: Substitute $m = 10$ and $a = 9.8$ into the formula:
    
$$
    F = 10 \times 9.8 = 98 \, \text{N}
    $$


#### Practical Applications of Substitution

**Finance**:
- Substituting values into interest formulas to calculate earnings or payments.

**Science**:
- Using formulas in physics and chemistry to find unknown quantities by substituting known values.

**Engineering**:
- Applying formulas to design and analyze systems by substituting specific measurements.

**Everyday Life**:
- Calculating areas, volumes, and other quantities by substituting dimensions into geometric formulas.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Evaluate the expression** $3a + 4b - 2c$ when $a = 2$, $b = 5$, and $c = 3$.
   - Solution: $3(2) + 4(5) - 2(3) = 6 + 20 - 6 = 20$.

2. **Find the value of $z$** in the equation $z = 4x - y$ when $x = 3$ and $y = 7$.
   - Solution: $z = 4(3) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5$.

3. **Substitute into the formula** for the volume of a cylinder $V = \pi r^2 h$ when $r = 3$ cm and $h = 10$ cm.
   - Solution: $V = \pi (3)^2 (10) = 90\pi \approx 282.74 \, \text{cm}^3$.

4. **Evaluate the expression** $p^2 + 2pq + q^2$ when $p = 1$ and $q = 4$.
   - Solution: $(1)^2 + 2(1)(4) + (4)^2 = 1 + 8 + 16 = 25$.

By mastering the process of substitution, students can effectively work with algebraic expressions and apply mathematical formulas to various contexts, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and mathematical understanding.
