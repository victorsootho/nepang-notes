### Factorizing Algebraic Expressions

Factorization is the process of breaking down an algebraic expression into a product of simpler factors. This is a key skill in algebra that allows for simplification and solving equations.

#### Factorizing Common Types of Expressions

**a) Expressions of the form $ax + ay$**

To factorize $ax + ay$, identify and extract the common factor $a$:

$$ ax + ay = a(x + y) $$


**Example:**

$$ 3x + 6y = 3(x + 2y) $$


**b) Expressions of the form $ax + bx + kay + kby$**

To factorize $ax + bx + kay + kby$, group terms and factor out the common factor in each group:

$$ ax + bx + kay + kby = (ax + bx) + (kay + kby) = x(a + b) + ky(a + b) = (a + b)(x + ky) $$


**Example:**

$$ 2x + 3x + 4ay + 6by = (2x + 3x) + (4ay + 6by) = x(2 + 3) + 2y(2a + 3b) = 5x + 2y(2a + 3b) $$


**c) Expressions of the form $a^2x^2 - b^2y^2$**

This is a difference of squares and can be factorized using the formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$:

$$ a^2x^2 - b^2y^2 = (ax - by)(ax + by) $$


**Example:**

$$ 4x^2 - 9y^2 = (2x - 3y)(2x + 3y) $$


**d) Expressions of the form $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$**

This is a perfect square trinomial and can be factorized using the formula $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$:

$$ a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2 $$


**Example:**

$$ x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 $$


**e) Expressions of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ where $a = 1$**

When $a = 1$, the quadratic trinomial $x^2 + bx + c$ can be factorized by finding two numbers that multiply to $c$ and add to $b$:

$$ x^2 + bx + c = (x + m)(x + n) $$

where $m \cdot n = c$ and $m + n = b$.

**Example:**

$$ x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) $$

Here, $m = 2$ and $n = 3$ since $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ and $2 + 3 = 5$.

#### Practice Problems

1. Factorize the following expressions:
   - $5x + 10y$
   - $4x + 6x + 8ay + 12by$
   - $9x^2 - 16y^2$
   - $x^2 + 8x + 16$
   - $x^2 + 7x + 12$

**Solutions:**

1. Factorize $5x + 10y$:
   
$$
   5x + 10y = 5(x + 2y)
   $$


2. Factorize $4x + 6x + 8ay + 12by$:
   
$$
   4x + 6x + 8ay + 12by = (4x + 6x) + (8ay + 12by) = x(4 + 6) + 4y(2a + 3b) = 10x + 4y(2a + 3b)
   $$


3. Factorize $9x^2 - 16y^2$:
   
$$
   9x^2 - 16y^2 = (3x - 4y)(3x + 4y)
   $$


4. Factorize $x^2 + 8x + 16$:
   
$$
   x^2 + 8x + 16 = (x + 4)^2
   $$


5. Factorize $x^2 + 7x + 12$:
   
$$
   x^2 + 7x + 12 = (x + 3)(x + 4)
   $$


By mastering the factorization of these common types of algebraic expressions, students will be better equipped to handle more complex algebraic manipulations and problem-solving.
