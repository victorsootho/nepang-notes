### Factorizing Algebraic Expressions

Factorizing algebraic expressions involves expressing the expression as a product of its factors. This is the reverse process of expanding algebraic expressions. Let's look at some specific forms and how to factorize them.

#### (a) Expressions of the Form $ax + ay$

To factorize an expression of this form, identify the common factor in both terms.

**Example:**

Factorize $6x + 8y$:

1. Identify the common factor: Both terms have a common factor of 2.
2. Factor out the common factor:
   
$$
   6x + 8y = 2(3x + 4y)
   $$


#### (b) Expressions of the Form $ax + bx + kay + kby$

For expressions of this form, group the terms and factor out the common factors in each group.

**Example:**

Factorize $x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6$:

1. Group the terms:
   
$$
   x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = (x^2 + 3x) + (2x + 6)
   $$

2. Factor out the common factors in each group:
   
$$
   x(x + 3) + 2(x + 3)
   $$

3. Notice the common factor $(x + 3)$:
   
$$
   x(x + 3) + 2(x + 3) = (x + 3)(x + 2)
   $$


#### (c) Expressions of the Form $a^2x^2 - b^2y^2$

This form is a difference of squares, which can be factorized using the formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$.

**Example:**

Factorize $9x^2 - 16y^2$:

1. Recognize the difference of squares:
   
$$
   9x^2 - 16y^2 = (3x)^2 - (4y)^2
   $$

2. Apply the difference of squares formula:
   
$$
   (3x)^2 - (4y)^2 = (3x - 4y)(3x + 4y)
   $$


#### (d) Expressions of the Form $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$

This form is a perfect square trinomial, which can be factorized using the formula $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2$.

**Example:**

Factorize $x^2 + 6x + 9$:

1. Recognize the perfect square trinomial:
   
$$
   x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x)^2 + 2(x)(3) + (3)^2
   $$

2. Apply the perfect square trinomial formula:
   
$$
   (x)^2 + 2(x)(3) + (3)^2 = (x + 3)^2
   $$


#### Practice Problems

1. Factorize the following expressions:
   - $4x + 12y$
   - $x^2 + 4x + 2x + 8$
   - $25a^2 - 36b^2$
   - $x^2 + 10x + 25$

**Solutions:**

1. Factorize $4x + 12y$:
   
$$
   4x + 12y = 4(x + 3y)
   $$


2. Factorize $x^2 + 4x + 2x + 8$:
   
$$
   x^2 + 4x + 2x + 8 = (x^2 + 4x) + (2x + 8) = x(x + 4) + 2(x + 4) = (x + 4)(x + 2)
   $$


3. Factorize $25a^2 - 36b^2$:
   
$$
   25a^2 - 36b^2 = (5a)^2 - (6b)^2 = (5a - 6b)(5a + 6b)
   $$


4. Factorize $x^2 + 10x + 25$:
   
$$
   x^2 + 10x + 25 = (x)^2 + 2(x)(5) + (5)^2 = (x + 5)^2
   $$


By practicing these techniques, students can become proficient in factorizing various forms of algebraic expressions, which is a fundamental skill in algebra.
