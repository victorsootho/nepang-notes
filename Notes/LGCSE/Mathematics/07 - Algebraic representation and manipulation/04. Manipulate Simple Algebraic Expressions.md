### Manipulating Simple Algebraic Expressions

Manipulating algebraic expressions involves performing operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to simplify or rewrite the expressions in different forms. This is fundamental in solving equations, analyzing functions, and understanding algebraic relationships.

#### Basic Operations on Algebraic Expressions

**Addition and Subtraction**

- To add or subtract algebraic expressions, combine like terms (terms that have the same variable raised to the same power).
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  3x + 4y - 2x + 5y = (3x - 2x) + (4y + 5y) = x + 9y
  $$


**Multiplication**

- To multiply algebraic expressions, use the distributive property (also known as expanding).
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  2x(3x + 4) = 2x \cdot 3x + 2x \cdot 4 = 6x^2 + 8x
  $$


**Division**

- To divide algebraic expressions, divide each term in the numerator by the term in the denominator.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  \frac{6x^2 + 8x}{2x} = \frac{6x^2}{2x} + \frac{8x}{2x} = 3x + 4
  $$


#### Combining Like Terms

**Like Terms**

- Terms that have the same variable and exponent can be combined.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  5a + 3b - 2a + 4b = (5a - 2a) + (3b + 4b) = 3a + 7b
  $$


**Distributive Property**

- Use the distributive property to expand and simplify expressions.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  3(2x + 5) = 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot 5 = 6x + 15
  $$


#### Factoring

**Factoring Out the Greatest Common Factor (GCF)**

- Identify the GCF of the terms in the expression and factor it out.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  4x^2 + 8x = 4x(x + 2)
  $$


**Factoring Quadratic Expressions**

- Factor expressions of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ by finding two numbers that multiply to $ac$ and add to $b$.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
  $$


#### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions

**Simplifying by Combining Like Terms**

- Combine like terms to simplify expressions.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  2x^2 + 3x + x^2 - x = (2x^2 + x^2) + (3x - x) = 3x^2 + 2x
  $$


**Simplifying Complex Fractions**

- Simplify complex fractions by finding a common denominator or by multiplying numerator and denominator by a common factor.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  \frac{\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y}}{\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{y}} = \frac{\frac{x + y}{xy}}{\frac{x - y}{xy}} = \frac{x + y}{x - y}
  $$


#### Example Problems

**Example 1: Combining Like Terms**

Simplify the expression $4x + 3 - 2x + 5$.

- Solution: Combine like terms:
  
$$
  4x - 2x + 3 + 5 = 2x + 8
  $$


**Example 2: Distributive Property**

Expand and simplify $3(a + 4) - 2(a - 5)$.

- Solution: Use the distributive property:
  
$$
  3a + 12 - 2a + 10 = (3a - 2a) + (12 + 10) = a + 22
  $$


**Example 3: Factoring**

Factor the expression $6x^2 + 9x$.

- Solution: Factor out the GCF:
  
$$
  6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)
  $$


**Example 4: Simplifying Fractions**

Simplify the fraction $\frac{8x^3}{4x}$.

- Solution: Divide each term in the numerator by the term in the denominator:
  
$$
  \frac{8x^3}{4x} = 2x^2
  $$


#### Practice Problems

1. **Combine Like Terms**: Simplify $5a + 3b - 2a + 4b$.
2. **Distributive Property**: Expand and simplify $2(3x + 4) - 3(x - 2)$.
3. **Factoring**: Factor the expression $12x^2 + 8x$.
4. **Simplify Fractions**: Simplify the fraction $\frac{10x^4}{5x^2}$.
