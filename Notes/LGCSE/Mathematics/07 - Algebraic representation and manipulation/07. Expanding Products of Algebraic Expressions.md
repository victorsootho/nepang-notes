### Expanding Products of Algebraic Expressions

Expanding products of algebraic expressions involves applying the distributive property to remove brackets and simplify the expression. This process is essential in algebra for simplifying expressions and solving equations.

#### The Distributive Property

The distributive property states that for any numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
a(b + c) = ab + ac
$$


This property can be extended to more complex algebraic expressions.

**Example: Simple Expansion**

Expand $3(x + 4)$:

$$
3(x + 4) = 3 \cdot x + 3 \cdot 4 = 3x + 12
$$


#### Expanding Binomials

A binomial is an algebraic expression containing two terms, such as $(a + b)$ or $(x - y)$. When multiplying two binomials, we use the distributive property multiple times.

**Example: Multiplying Binomials**

Expand $(x + 3)(x - 2)$:

$$
(x + 3)(x - 2) = x(x - 2) + 3(x - 2) = x^2 - 2x + 3x - 6 = x^2 + x - 6
$$


#### FOIL Method for Binomials

The FOIL method is a specific technique for expanding the product of two binomials. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last.

**Example: FOIL Method**

Expand $(2x + 5)(x - 3)$:

$$
(2x + 5)(x - 3)
$$

- **First**: Multiply the first terms: $2x \cdot x = 2x^2$
- **Outer**: Multiply the outer terms: $2x \cdot -3 = -6x$
- **Inner**: Multiply the inner terms: $5 \cdot x = 5x$
- **Last**: Multiply the last terms: $5 \cdot -3 = -15$

Combine all terms:

$$
2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15 = 2x^2 - x - 15
$$


#### Expanding Polynomials

When expanding products involving polynomials with more than two terms, apply the distributive property sequentially.

**Example: Polynomial Expansion**

Expand $(x + 2)(x^2 - x + 1)$:

$$
(x + 2)(x^2 - x + 1) = x(x^2 - x + 1) + 2(x^2 - x + 1)
$$

Distribute each term:

$$
= x^3 - x^2 + x + 2x^2 - 2x + 2
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
= x^3 + x^2 - x + 2
$$


#### Practice Problems

1. Expand the following expressions:
   - $(3x + 2)(x - 4)$
   - $(x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 3)$
   - $(2x + 3)(3x - 5)$
   - $(a + b)(a - b)$

**Solutions:**

1. Expand $(3x + 2)(x - 4)$:
   
$$
   (3x + 2)(x - 4) = 3x(x - 4) + 2(x - 4) = 3x^2 - 12x + 2x - 8 = 3x^2 - 10x - 8
   $$


2. Expand $(x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 3)$:
   
$$
   (x - 1)(x^2 + 2x + 3) = x(x^2 + 2x + 3) - 1(x^2 + 2x + 3) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - x^2 - 2x - 3 = x^3 + x^2 + x - 3
   $$


3. Expand $(2x + 3)(3x - 5)$:
   
$$
   (2x + 3)(3x - 5) = 2x(3x - 5) + 3(3x - 5) = 6x^2 - 10x + 9x - 15 = 6x^2 - x - 15
   $$


4. Expand $(a + b)(a - b)$ using the difference of squares formula:
   
$$
   (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
   $$
