### Expressing Basic Arithmetic Processes Algebraically

Understanding how to express basic arithmetic processes algebraically is a crucial skill in algebra. This involves representing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using variables and constants. Below, we will explore how these processes can be expressed and manipulated algebraically.

#### Addition

**Addition in Algebra**
Addition in algebra involves combining like terms (terms that have the same variable raised to the same power).

- **Example**: The sum of $a$ and $b$ is written as $a + b$.
  - If $a = 5$ and $b = 3$, then $a + b = 5 + 3 = 8$.

- **Combining Like Terms**: Combine terms with the same variable.
  - **Example**: $2x + 3x = (2 + 3)x = 5x$.

#### Subtraction

**Subtraction in Algebra**
Subtraction in algebra involves removing one quantity from another, and like addition, it also involves combining like terms.

- **Example**: The difference between $a$ and $b$ is written as $a - b$.
  - If $a = 9$ and $b = 4$, then $a - b = 9 - 4 = 5$.

- **Combining Like Terms**: Combine terms with the same variable.
  - **Example**: $5x - 2x = (5 - 2)x = 3x$.

#### Multiplication

**Multiplication in Algebra**
Multiplication in algebra involves scaling one quantity by another. This is often represented using coefficients and variables.

- **Example**: The product of $a$ and $b$ is written as $a \cdot b$ or $ab$.
  - If $a = 4$ and $b = 6$, then $ab = 4 \cdot 6 = 24$.

- **Distributive Property**: Multiply each term inside a parenthesis by a factor outside the parenthesis.
  - **Example**: $a(b + c) = ab + ac$.
    - If $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 4$, then $2(3 + 4) = 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 4 = 6 + 8 = 14$.

#### Division

**Division in Algebra**
Division in algebra involves distributing a quantity into equal parts. This is represented using fractions or division symbols.

- **Example**: The quotient of $a$ divided by $b$ is written as $\frac{a}{b}$ or $a \div b$.
  - If $a = 20$ and $b = 5$, then $\frac{20}{5} = 4$.

- **Simplifying Fractions**: Divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.
  - **Example**: $\frac{6x}{3} = \frac{6}{3} \cdot \frac{x}{1} = 2x$.

#### Example Problems

1. **Addition and Subtraction**:
   - Combine $4a + 3b$ and $2a - b$.
     - Solution: $4a + 3b + 2a - b = (4a + 2a) + (3b - b) = 6a + 2b$.

2. **Multiplication**:
   - Expand $3x(2x + 5)$.
     - Solution: $3x \cdot 2x + 3x \cdot 5 = 6x^2 + 15x$.

3. **Division**:
   - Simplify $\frac{12x^2}{3x}$.
     - Solution: $\frac{12x^2}{3x} = 4x$.

4. **Using the Distributive Property**:
   - Simplify $5(a + 4) - 3(a - 2)$.
     - Solution: $5a + 20 - 3a + 6 = (5a - 3a) + (20 + 6) = 2a + 26$.

#### Summary

By expressing basic arithmetic processes algebraically, we can generalize numerical operations and solve a wide range of mathematical problems. Understanding these fundamental concepts lays the groundwork for more advanced algebraic manipulation and problem-solving.
