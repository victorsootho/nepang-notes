### Factorizing Quadratic Expressions of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$

Factorizing quadratic expressions where the coefficient of $x^2$ ($a$) is an integer involves finding two binomials whose product gives the original quadratic expression. The general approach involves finding factors of the constant term ($c$) and the leading coefficient ($a$) that add up to the middle term ($b$). Here are the steps and examples to illustrate the process:

#### Steps to Factorize $ax^2 + bx + c$

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**: Find the product of the leading coefficient ($a$) and the constant term ($c$).
2. **Find Factors**: Identify two numbers that multiply to $ac$ and add up to $b$.
3. **Rewrite the Middle Term**: Use the two identified numbers to split the middle term ($bx$).
4. **Factor by Grouping**: Group the terms into two binomials and factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each group.
5. **Combine the Factors**: The factored form will be the product of two binomials.

#### Example 1: Factorizing $2x^2 + 5x + 3$

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**:
   
$$
   2 \times 3 = 6
   $$

2. **Find Factors**: Identify two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. These numbers are 2 and 3.
3. **Rewrite the Middle Term**:
   
$$
   2x^2 + 2x + 3x + 3
   $$

4. **Factor by Grouping**:
   
$$
   (2x^2 + 2x) + (3x + 3) = 2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1)
   $$

5. **Combine the Factors**:
   
$$
   2x(x + 1) + 3(x + 1) = (2x + 3)(x + 1)
   $$


Thus, the factored form of $2x^2 + 5x + 3$ is $(2x + 3)(x + 1)$.

#### Example 2: Factorizing $3x^2 + 7x + 2$

1. **Multiply $a$ and $c$**:
   
$$
   3 \times 2 = 6
   $$

2. **Find Factors**: Identify two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 7. These numbers are 1 and 6.
3. **Rewrite the Middle Term**:
   
$$
   3x^2 + x + 6x + 2
   $$

4. **Factor by Grouping**:
   
$$
   (3x^2 + x) + (6x + 2) = x(3x + 1) + 2(3x + 1)
   $$

5. **Combine the Factors**:
   
$$
   x(3x + 1) + 2(3x + 1) = (x + 2)(3x + 1)
   $$


Thus, the factored form of $3x^2 + 7x + 2$ is $(x + 2)(3x + 1)$.
