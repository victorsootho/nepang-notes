### Simplifying Algebraic Expressions with Numeric Denominators

When simplifying algebraic expressions involving fractions with numeric denominators, the goal is to combine the fractions into a single simplified expression. This often involves finding a common denominator.

#### Example: Simplify $\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x-4}{2}$

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the denominators:** The denominators are 3 and 2.

2. **Find the least common denominator (LCD):** The LCD of 3 and 2 is 6.

3. **Rewrite each fraction with the LCD as the new denominator:**

   - For $\frac{x}{3}$, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2:
     
$$
     \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x \cdot 2}{3 \cdot 2} = \frac{2x}{6}
     $$


   - For $\frac{x-4}{2}$, multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3:
     
$$
     \frac{x-4}{2} = \frac{(x-4) \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{3(x-4)}{6} = \frac{3x - 12}{6}
     $$


4. **Combine the fractions:**
   
$$
   \frac{2x}{6} + \frac{3x - 12}{6} = \frac{2x + 3x - 12}{6} = \frac{5x - 12}{6}
   $$


5. **Simplify the expression (if possible):** In this case, the expression is already in its simplest form:
   
$$
   \frac{5x - 12}{6}
   $$


#### Practice Problems

1. Simplify $\frac{y}{4} + \frac{y-3}{5}$.
2. Simplify $\frac{2z}{7} + \frac{3z+1}{2}$.
3. Simplify $\frac{a+1}{3} + \frac{2a-5}{4}$.

**Solutions:**

1. Simplify $\frac{y}{4} + \frac{y-3}{5}$:
   
$$
   \frac{y}{4} + \frac{y-3}{5} = \frac{5y}{20} + \frac{4(y-3)}{20} = \frac{5y + 4y - 12}{20} = \frac{9y - 12}{20}
   $$


2. Simplify $\frac{2z}{7} + \frac{3z+1}{2}$:
   
$$
   \frac{2z}{7} + \frac{3z+1}{2} = \frac{2z \cdot 2}{14} + \frac{(3z+1) \cdot 7}{14} = \frac{4z}{14} + \frac{21z + 7}{14} = \frac{4z + 21z + 7}{14} = \frac{25z + 7}{14}
   $$


3. Simplify $\frac{a+1}{3} + \frac{2a-5}{4}$:
   
$$
   \frac{a+1}{3} + \frac{2a-5}{4} = \frac{(a+1) \cdot 4}{12} + \frac{(2a-5) \cdot 3}{12} = \frac{4(a+1)}{12} + \frac{3(2a-5)}{12} = \frac{4a + 4 + 6a - 15}{12} = \frac{10a - 11}{12}
   $$


By following these steps, you can simplify algebraic expressions involving fractions with numeric denominators, ensuring the final expression is as simplified as possible.
