### Using Brackets and Extracting Common Factors

When simplifying or manipulating algebraic expressions, using brackets and extracting common factors are essential techniques. These methods help in organizing and simplifying expressions, making it easier to solve equations or analyze algebraic relationships.

#### Using Brackets

Brackets are used to group terms in an expression, ensuring the correct order of operations. They can also help in expanding or factoring expressions.

**Example: Distributive Property**

- Distributive property involves removing brackets by distributing the factor outside the bracket to each term inside the bracket.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  a(b + c) = ab + ac
  $$

  
$$
  3(x + 4) = 3x + 12
  $$


**Example: Expanding Expressions**

- Expanding an expression involves removing the brackets by multiplying each term inside the bracket by the term outside.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  2(3x - 5) = 2 \cdot 3x - 2 \cdot 5 = 6x - 10
  $$


**Example: Using Brackets for Grouping**

- Brackets are used to group terms and indicate the order in which operations should be performed.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  5 + 3(2x - 4) = 5 + (6x - 12) = 6x - 7
  $$


#### Extracting Common Factors

Extracting common factors involves identifying and factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) from each term in an expression. This simplifies the expression and is useful in solving equations.

**Steps for Extracting Common Factors**

1. **Identify the GCF**: Determine the greatest common factor of all terms in the expression.
2. **Factor Out the GCF**: Write the expression as the product of the GCF and the remaining terms inside a bracket.

**Example: Factoring Out the GCF**

- Identify the GCF and factor it out from the expression.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  6x^2 + 9x = 3x(2x + 3)
  $$


**Example: Factoring Polynomial Expressions**

- Factor out the GCF from polynomial expressions.
  
  **Example:**
  
$$
  8y^3 - 4y^2 = 4y^2(2y - 1)
  $$


#### Practice Problems

**Example 1: Using Brackets and Distributive Property**

Simplify the expression $4(2x + 3) - 5(x - 2)$.

- Solution:
  
$$
  4(2x + 3) - 5(x - 2) = 8x + 12 - 5x + 10 = 8x - 5x + 12 + 10 = 3x + 22
  $$


**Example 2: Extracting Common Factors**

Factor out the GCF from the expression $12x^3 - 18x^2 + 24x$.

- Solution:
  
$$
  12x^3 - 18x^2 + 24x = 6x(2x^2 - 3x + 4)
  $$


**Example 3: Using Brackets for Grouping**

Simplify the expression $2x(3x - 4) + x(2x + 5)$.

- Solution:
  
$$
  2x(3x - 4) + x(2x + 5) = 6x^2 - 8x + 2x^2 + 5x = (6x^2 + 2x^2) + (-8x + 5x) = 8x^2 - 3x
  $$


**Example 4: Factoring Polynomial Expressions**

Factor out the GCF from the expression $15a^2b - 25ab^2 + 35ab$.

- Solution:
  
$$
  15a^2b - 25ab^2 + 35ab = 5ab(3a - 5b + 7)
  $$
