### Standard Form: $A \times 10^n$

Standard form (or scientific notation) is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable format. It is particularly useful in scientific, engineering, and mathematical contexts to simplify calculations and comparisons.

#### Definition

A number is expressed in standard form as:


$$ A \times 10^n $$


where:
- $A$ is a number such that $1 \leq A < 10$.
- $n$ is an integer that represents the exponent or power of 10.

#### Converting Numbers to Standard Form

To convert a number to standard form, follow these steps:

1. **Move the Decimal Point:** Shift the decimal point in the original number so that it is positioned after the first non-zero digit. Count the number of places the decimal point is moved.

2. **Determine the Exponent $n$:** 
   - If you moved the decimal point to the left, $n$ is positive.
   - If you moved the decimal point to the right, $n$ is negative.

3. **Write in Standard Form:** Express the number as $A \times 10^n$, where $A$ is the resulting number from step 1 and $n$ is the exponent determined in step 2.

#### Examples

1. **Large Number: 52,000**

   - Move the decimal point 4 places to the left: 52,000 → 5.2
   - Since the decimal was moved 4 places to the left, $n = 4$.
   - Standard form: $5.2 \times 10^4$

2. **Small Number: 0.00034**

   - Move the decimal point 4 places to the right: 0.00034 → 3.4
   - Since the decimal was moved 4 places to the right, $n = -4$.
   - Standard form: $3.4 \times 10^{-4}$

3. **Very Large Number: 1,000,000,000**

   - Move the decimal point 9 places to the left: 1,000,000,000 → 1.0
   - Since the decimal was moved 9 places to the left, $n = 9$.
   - Standard form: $1.0 \times 10^9$

4. **Very Small Number: 0.0000012**

   - Move the decimal point 6 places to the right: 0.0000012 → 1.2
   - Since the decimal was moved 6 places to the right, $n = -6$.
   - Standard form: $1.2 \times 10^{-6}$

#### Using Standard Form in Calculations

Standard form simplifies the multiplication and division of very large or small numbers. Here are some key operations:

1. **Multiplication:**

   
$$
   (A \times 10^m) \times (B \times 10^n) = (A \times B) \times 10^{m+n}
   $$


   **Example:**

   
$$
   (2.5 \times 10^3) \times (4.0 \times 10^2) = (2.5 \times 4.0) \times 10^{3+2} = 10.0 \times 10^5 = 1.0 \times 10^6
   $$


2. **Division:**

   
$$
   \frac{A \times 10^m}{B \times 10^n} = \left(\frac{A}{B}\right) \times 10^{m-n}
   $$


   **Example:**

   
$$
   \frac{6.0 \times 10^4}{3.0 \times 10^2} = \left(\frac{6.0}{3.0}\right) \times 10^{4-2} = 2.0 \times 10^2
   $$


3. **Addition and Subtraction:**

   Convert to the same power of 10 before performing addition or subtraction.

   **Example:**

   
$$
   3.0 \times 10^4 + 4.5 \times 10^3 = 3.0 \times 10^4 + 0.45 \times 10^4 = 3.45 \times 10^4
   $$


### Summary

Standard form provides a clear and efficient way to handle very large and very small numbers by expressing them as $A \times 10^n$, where $1 \leq A < 10$ and $n$ is an integer. This notation simplifies mathematical operations and makes it easier to work with numbers across a wide range of magnitudes.
