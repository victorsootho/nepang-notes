Solving equations involving indices (exponents) requires an understanding of the rules and properties of indices. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solving such equations, including examples to illustrate the process.

### Key Properties of Indices

1. **Multiplication of Powers:**
   
$$ a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} $$


2. **Division of Powers:**
   
$$ \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} $$


3. **Power of a Power:**
   
$$ (a^m)^n = a^{mn} $$


4. **Negative Indices:**
   
$$ a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} $$


5. **Fractional Indices:**
   
$$ a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} $$


### Solving Equations

#### 1. **Solving Simple Exponential Equations**

**Example 1:**
Solve for $x$:

$$ 2^x = 16 $$


**Solution:**
- Recognize that $16$ can be expressed as a power of $2$:
  
$$ 16 = 2^4 $$

- Therefore:
  
$$ 2^x = 2^4 $$

- Since the bases are the same, equate the exponents:
  
$$ x = 4 $$


**Example 2:**
Solve for $y$:

$$ 5^{2y} = 25 $$


**Solution:**
- Express $25$ as a power of $5$:
  
$$ 25 = 5^2 $$

- Therefore:
  
$$ 5^{2y} = 5^2 $$

- Equate the exponents:
  
$$ 2y = 2 $$

  
$$ y = 1 $$


#### 2. **Solving Equations with Negative Indices**

**Example 1:**
Solve for $z$:

$$ 3^{-z} = \frac{1}{27} $$


**Solution:**
- Express $\frac{1}{27}$ as a power of $3$:
  
$$ \frac{1}{27} = 3^{-3} $$

- Therefore:
  
$$ 3^{-z} = 3^{-3} $$

- Equate the exponents:
  
$$ -z = -3 $$

  
$$ z = 3 $$


**Example 2:**
Solve for $x$:

$$ \frac{2^{-x}}{4} = 1 $$


**Solution:**
- Express $4$ as a power of $2$:
  
$$ 4 = 2^2 $$

- Therefore:
  
$$ \frac{2^{-x}}{2^2} = 1 $$

- Simplify using properties of indices:
  
$$ 2^{-x-2} = 1 $$

- Since $1$ can be written as $2^0$:
  
$$ 2^{-x-2} = 2^0 $$

- Equate the exponents:
  
$$ -x - 2 = 0 $$

  
$$ -x = 2 $$

  
$$ x = -2 $$


#### 3. **Solving Equations with Fractional Indices**

**Example 1:**
Solve for $a$:

$$ a^{\frac{3}{2}} = 8 $$


**Solution:**
- To isolate $a$, raise both sides to the reciprocal of $\frac{3}{2}$:
  
$$ \left(a^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 8^{\frac{2}{3}} $$

- Simplify:
  
$$ a = 8^{\frac{2}{3}} $$

- Express $8$ as a power of $2$:
  
$$ 8 = 2^3 $$

  
$$ 8^{\frac{2}{3}} = \left(2^3\right)^{\frac{2}{3}} = 2^{3 \times \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4 $$

- Therefore:
  
$$ a = 4 $$


**Example 2:**
Solve for $b$:

$$ \sqrt{b} = 5 $$


**Solution:**
- Express the square root as a fractional index:
  
$$ b^{\frac{1}{2}} = 5 $$

- Square both sides to isolate $b$:
  
$$ \left(b^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)^2 = 5^2 $$

  
$$ b = 25 $$


### Summary

Solving equations involving indices involves using properties of exponents to isolate the variable. Key steps include expressing numbers in terms of their base powers, equating exponents when the bases are the same, and manipulating indices according to their rules. These techniques enable you to solve a wide range of exponential equations effectively.
