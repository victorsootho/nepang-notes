### Indices


Understanding indices (also known as exponents or powers) is essential for working with large and small numbers efficiently. Indices allow us to express repeated multiplication concisely. This section covers the use and interpretation of positive, negative, zero, and positive fractional indices, specifically focusing on fractional indices with 1 as the numerator.

#### Positive Indices

A positive index indicates how many times a number (the base) is multiplied by itself.

**Example:**
- $5^3 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$

#### Negative Indices

A negative index represents the reciprocal of the base raised to the corresponding positive index.

**Example:**
- $5^{-2} = \frac{1}{5^2} = \frac{1}{25}$

#### Zero Index

Any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one. This is a fundamental property of indices.

**Example:**
- $7^0 = 1$

#### Positive Fractional Indices

A positive fractional index indicates a root of the base. When the numerator of the fraction is 1, it signifies the specific root corresponding to the denominator.

**Example:**
- $16^{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4$
- $27^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3$

#### Properties of Indices

1. **Multiplication:** $a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
2. **Division:** $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$
3. **Power of a Power:** $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
4. **Root of a Power:** $(a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m})$

#### Standard Form

Standard form (also known as scientific notation) is a method of writing very large or very small numbers in the form $a \times 10^n$, where $1 \leq a < 10$ and $n$ is an integer.

**Example:**
- 5000 = $5 \times 10^3$
- 0.003 = $3 \times 10^{-3}$

Standard form is especially useful in scientific calculations to simplify the handling of extremely large or small values.

### Examples

1. **Interpreting Positive and Negative Indices:**
   - $2^4 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16$
   - $2^{-4} = \frac{1}{2^4} = \frac{1}{16}$

2. **Applying Zero Index:**
   - $9^0 = 1$

3. **Using Fractional Indices:**
   - $64^{\frac{1}{3}} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4$
   - $81^{\frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt[4]{81} = 3$

4. **Converting to Standard Form:**
   - 45000 = $4.5 \times 10^4$
   - 0.00056 = $5.6 \times 10^{-4}$

### Summary

Indices provide a concise way to represent repeated multiplication and the roots of numbers. By understanding and applying the properties of indices, including positive, negative, zero, and fractional indices, students can handle a wide range of mathematical problems more efficiently. Standard form further simplifies the representation and manipulation of large and small numbers, making it an invaluable tool in both academic and practical contexts.
