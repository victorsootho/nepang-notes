### Estimations and Limits of Accuracy (Continued)

When dealing with measurements, itâ€™s essential to understand the concept of upper and lower bounds. These bounds define the range within which the true value of a measurement lies, given the specified accuracy. This section will cover how to determine appropriate upper and lower bounds for data provided to a specific accuracy.

#### Upper and Lower Bounds

The **upper bound** is the maximum value that a measurement could be, given its precision, while the **lower bound** is the minimum value. These bounds are determined based on the smallest unit of measurement used.

**Example:**
- A length is measured as 12.3 cm to the nearest 0.1 cm.
  - Lower bound: $12.3 \text{ cm} - 0.05 \text{ cm} = 12.25 \text{ cm}$
  - Upper bound: $12.3 \text{ cm} + 0.05 \text{ cm} = 12.35 \text{ cm}$

This means the true length is between 12.25 cm and 12.35 cm.

#### Determining Bounds for Whole Numbers

For measurements given to the nearest whole number, the bounds are determined by considering half a unit above and below the given number.

**Example:**
- A length is measured as 8 m to the nearest meter.
  - Lower bound: $8 \text{ m} - 0.5 \text{ m} = 7.5 \text{ m}$
  - Upper bound: $8 \text{ m} + 0.5 \text{ m} = 8.5 \text{ m}$

Thus, the true length lies between 7.5 m and 8.5 m.

#### Determining Bounds for Decimal Places

For measurements given to a specific number of decimal places, the bounds are determined by half of the smallest decimal place.

**Example:**
- A mass is measured as 2.47 kg to the nearest 0.01 kg.
  - Lower bound: $2.47 \text{ kg} - 0.005 \text{ kg} = 2.465 \text{ kg}$
  - Upper bound: $2.47 \text{ kg} + 0.005 \text{ kg} = 2.475 \text{ kg}$

Therefore, the true mass lies between 2.465 kg and 2.475 kg.

#### Determining Bounds for Significant Figures

When a measurement is given to a certain number of significant figures, the bounds are determined based on the precision implied by the significant figures.

**Example:**
- A distance is measured as 1.50 km to three significant figures.
  - Lower bound: $1.50 \text{ km} - 0.005 \text{ km} = 1.495 \text{ km}$
  - Upper bound: $1.50 \text{ km} + 0.005 \text{ km} = 1.505 \text{ km}$

The true distance is between 1.495 km and 1.505 km.

#### Applying Bounds in Context

In practical applications, upper and lower bounds help define the range of possible values for measurements, ensuring calculations account for the potential variance. This is crucial in fields like engineering, construction, and science, where precision is vital.

**Example: Calculating the Perimeter of a Rectangle**

- Measured lengths: 10.2 cm and 5.6 cm, both to the nearest 0.1 cm.
  - Lower bound for length: $10.2 \text{ cm} - 0.05 \text{ cm} = 10.15 \text{ cm}$
  - Upper bound for length: $10.2 \text{ cm} + 0.05 \text{ cm} = 10.25 \text{ cm}$
  - Lower bound for width: $5.6 \text{ cm} - 0.05 \text{ cm} = 5.55 \text{ cm}$
  - Upper bound for width: $5.6 \text{ cm} + 0.05 \text{ cm} = 5.65 \text{ cm}$

- Calculate the perimeter using bounds:
  - Lower bound: $2 \times (10.15 \text{ cm} + 5.55 \text{ cm}) = 2 \times 15.7 \text{ cm} = 31.4 \text{ cm}$
  - Upper bound: $2 \times (10.25 \text{ cm} + 5.65 \text{ cm}) = 2 \times 15.9 \text{ cm} = 31.8 \text{ cm}$

The perimeter of the rectangle lies between 31.4 cm and 31.8 cm.

#### Summary

Understanding and applying upper and lower bounds ensures that measurements and calculations are accurate and reliable within specified limits. By mastering these concepts, students can confidently handle various mathematical problems and real-world scenarios where precision and accuracy are crucial.
