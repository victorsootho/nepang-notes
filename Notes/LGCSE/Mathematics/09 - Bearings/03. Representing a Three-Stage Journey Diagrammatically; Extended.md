### Representing a Three-Stage Journey Diagrammatically

A three-stage journey involves traveling from one point to another in three separate legs or stages, with changes in direction between stages. Representing such journeys diagrammatically can help in visualizing the path taken and understanding the bearings involved.

#### Example: Representing a Three-Stage Journey

Let's consider a journey that starts at Point A, travels to Point B, then to Point C, and finally to Point D. The bearings and distances for each stage are given.

1. **Journey from A to B**:
   - Distance: 4 km
   - Bearing: 030° (Northeast)

2. **Journey from B to C**:
   - Distance: 3 km
   - Bearing: 120° (Southeast)

3. **Journey from C to D**:
   - Distance: 5 km
   - Bearing: 210° (Southwest)

#### Steps to Represent the Journey

1. **Draw a North Line**: Start by drawing a vertical line representing the north direction at Point A.

2. **Stage 1: A to B**:
   - Use a protractor to measure 30° clockwise from the north line at Point A.
   - Draw a line 4 km long in the direction of this bearing (030°).
   - Label the endpoint as Point B.

3. **Draw a North Line at Point B**: Draw another vertical north line at Point B.

4. **Stage 2: B to C**:
   - Use a protractor to measure 120° clockwise from the north line at Point B.
   - Draw a line 3 km long in the direction of this bearing (120°).
   - Label the endpoint as Point C.

5. **Draw a North Line at Point C**: Draw another vertical north line at Point C.

6. **Stage 3: C to D**:
   - Use a protractor to measure 210° clockwise from the north line at Point C.
   - Draw a line 5 km long in the direction of this bearing (210°).
   - Label the endpoint as Point D.

#### Diagram

Here is a simple diagram representing the three-stage journey:

           |       / 5 km
           |      /
           |     /
           |    /

      / 4 km      \
     /             \
   C               3 km
```

#### Explanation of the Diagram

- **Point A**: The starting point of the journey.
- **North Line at A**: Indicates the reference direction for the first stage.
- **Line from A to B**: Represents the first stage of the journey, with a distance of 4 km and a bearing of 030°.
- **Point B**: The first intermediate point where the direction changes.
- **North Line at B**: Indicates the reference direction for the second stage.
- **Line from B to C**: Represents the second stage of the journey, with a distance of 3 km and a bearing of 120°.
- **Point C**: The second intermediate point where the direction changes.
- **North Line at C**: Indicates the reference direction for the third stage.
- **Line from C to D**: Represents the third stage of the journey, with a distance of 5 km and a bearing of 210°.
- **Point D**: The final destination of the journey.

#### Practice Problem

1. **Diagram a Three-Stage Journey**:
   - **Journey from P to Q**:
     - Distance: 6 km
     - Bearing: 045° (Northeast)
   - **Journey from Q to R**:
     - Distance: 4 km
     - Bearing: 090° (East)
   - **Journey from R to S**:
     - Distance: 5 km
     - Bearing: 135° (Southeast)

2. **Solution**:
   - Draw the north line at Point P.
   - Measure 45° clockwise and draw a 6 km line to Point Q.
   - Draw the north line at Point Q.
   - Measure 90° clockwise and draw a 4 km line to Point R.
   - Draw the north line at Point R.
   - Measure 135° clockwise and draw a 5 km line to Point S.

By practicing the representation of multi-stage journeys diagrammatically, students will enhance their spatial reasoning and understanding of bearings in navigation.
