### Representing a Two-Stage Journey Diagrammatically

A two-stage journey involves traveling from one point to another in two separate legs or stages, often with a change in direction between stages. Representing such journeys diagrammatically can help in visualizing the path taken and understanding the bearings involved.

#### Example: Representing a Two-Stage Journey

Let's consider a journey that starts at Point A, travels to Point B, and then proceeds to Point C. The bearings and distances for each stage are given.

1. **Journey from A to B**:
   - Distance: 5 km
   - Bearing: 045° (Northeast)

2. **Journey from B to C**:
   - Distance: 3 km
   - Bearing: 120° (Southeast)

#### Steps to Represent the Journey

1. **Draw a North Line**: Start by drawing a vertical line representing the north direction at Point A.

2. **Stage 1: A to B**:
   - Use a protractor to measure 45° clockwise from the north line at Point A.
   - Draw a line 5 km long in the direction of this bearing (045°).
   - Label the endpoint as Point B.

3. **Draw a North Line at Point B**: Draw another vertical north line at Point B.

4. **Stage 2: B to C**:
   - Use a protractor to measure 120° clockwise from the north line at Point B.
   - Draw a line 3 km long in the direction of this bearing (120°).
   - Label the endpoint as Point C.

#### Diagram

Here is a simple diagram representing the two-stage journey:

```

#### Explanation of the Diagram

- **Point A**: The starting point of the journey.
- **North Line at A**: Indicates the reference direction for the first stage.
- **Line from A to B**: Represents the first stage of the journey, with a distance of 5 km and a bearing of 045°.
- **Point B**: The intermediate point where the direction changes.
- **North Line at B**: Indicates the reference direction for the second stage.
- **Line from B to C**: Represents the second stage of the journey, with a distance of 3 km and a bearing of 120°.
- **Point C**: The final destination of the journey.

#### Practice Problem

1. **Diagram a Two-Stage Journey**:
   - **Journey from X to Y**:
     - Distance: 4 km
     - Bearing: 030° (Northeast)
   - **Journey from Y to Z**:
     - Distance: 6 km
     - Bearing: 150° (Southeast)

2. **Solution**:
   - Draw the north line at Point X.
   - Measure 30° clockwise and draw a 4 km line to Point Y.
   - Draw the north line at Point Y.
   - Measure 150° clockwise and draw a 6 km line to Point Z.

By practicing the representation of multi-stage journeys diagrammatically, students will enhance their spatial reasoning and understanding of bearings in navigation.
