### Bearings

Bearings are a method of describing direction using angles measured clockwise from the north line. Bearings are commonly used in navigation and map reading to give precise directions.

#### Understanding Bearings

Bearings are always given as three-figure numbers, ranging from 000° to 360°. This ensures clarity and avoids ambiguity in direction.

- **000°** or **360°**: Due North
- **090°**: Due East
- **180°**: Due South
- **270°**: Due West

#### Interpreting Bearings

1. **Three-Figure Bearings**: Always expressed in three digits, ensuring any direction can be clearly communicated.
   - **Example**: 045° indicates a direction 45 degrees clockwise from due north.

2. **Clockwise Measurement**: Bearings are measured clockwise from the north line.
   - **Example**: A bearing of 135° means turning 135 degrees clockwise from due north, pointing southeast.

#### Using Bearings

To determine a bearing from one point to another:
1. **Draw a North Line**: From the starting point, draw a vertical line representing north.
2. **Measure Clockwise**: Use a protractor to measure the angle clockwise from the north line to the direction of travel or target.

#### Examples

1. **Finding Bearings**:
   - **From A to B**:
     - Place the protractor at point A.
     - Align the 0° mark with the north line.
     - Measure the angle clockwise to point B.
     - Record the angle as a three-figure bearing.

   - **Example**:
     - If the angle measured is 75°, the bearing is 075°.
   
2. **Interpreting Bearings**:
   - **Given Bearing**:
     - A ship is sailing on a bearing of 120°.
     - This means the ship is moving 120 degrees clockwise from due north, in a southeast direction.

#### Practice Problems

1. **Find the Bearing**:
   - **Problem**: What is the bearing from point A to point B if point B is directly east of point A?
   - **Solution**: The bearing from A to B is 090°.

2. **Use the Bearing**:
   - **Problem**: A plane takes off on a bearing of 210°. In which general direction is it flying?
   - **Solution**: The plane is flying southwest (210° is 30 degrees past south).

3. **Determine the Position**:
   - **Problem**: A person walks 5 km north, then 3 km east. What is the bearing from the starting point to the endpoint?
   - **Solution**:
     - Draw the north line and measure the clockwise angle to the endpoint.
     - Use trigonometry to find the bearing.
     - Calculate: $\theta = \tan^{-1} \left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \approx 31°$
     - Bearing: $031°$

4. **Given Bearings**:
   - **Problem**: A boat sails from point X to point Y on a bearing of 245°. What direction is it heading?
   - **Solution**: The boat is heading slightly southwest.

By mastering the interpretation and use of three-figure bearings, students will enhance their ability to navigate and understand directions accurately.
