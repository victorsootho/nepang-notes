### Number

#### Directed Numbers in Practical Situations
Directed numbers, also known as signed numbers, include both positive and negative numbers. They are used to represent quantities that can have both an increase and a decrease. Practical applications of directed numbers are abundant in daily life, including financial transactions, temperature changes, elevations, and more.

1. **Financial Transactions**: 
   - Deposits are considered positive numbers.
   - Withdrawals are represented by negative numbers.

2. **Temperature Changes**:
   - Increases in temperature are positive.
   - Decreases in temperature are negative.

3. **Elevations**:
   - Heights above sea level are positive.
   - Depths below sea level are negative.

**Example**: If the temperature was -5°C in the morning and rose by 8°C by noon, the new temperature would be 3°C.

#### Types of Numbers

1. **Natural Numbers**:
   - Also known as counting numbers.
   - Examples: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

2. **Integers**:
   - Includes all whole numbers (positive, negative, and zero).
   - Examples: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

3. **Prime Numbers**:
   - Numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves.
   - Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...

4. **Composite Numbers**:
   - Numbers greater than 1 that have more than two positive divisors.
   - Examples: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, ...

5. **Common Factors and Common Multiples**:
   - **Common Factors**: Numbers that are factors of two or more numbers.
     - Example: The common factors of 12 and 18 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
   - **Common Multiples**: Numbers that are multiples of two or more numbers.
     - Example: The common multiples of 4 and 5 are 20, 40, 60, ...

6. **Rational and Irrational Numbers**:
   - **Rational Numbers**: Numbers that can be expressed as a fraction $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b \neq 0$.
     - Examples: $\frac{1}{2}$, 0.75, -3, 4, ...
   - **Irrational Numbers**: Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction; their decimal expansion is non-repeating and non-terminating.
     - Examples: $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, $\sqrt{3}$, ...

7. **Real Numbers**:
   - The set of all rational and irrational numbers.
   - Examples: -1, 0, 2.5, $\pi$, $\sqrt{2}$, ...

**Important Properties and Theorems**:

1. **The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**:
   - Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - The largest positive integer that divides two or more integers without leaving a remainder.

3. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
   - The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more integers.

#### Practical Applications

1. **Problem Solving with Integers**:
   - Understanding how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive and negative numbers.
   - **Example**: $-7 + 5 = -2$

2. **Real-World Applications of Rational and Irrational Numbers**:
   - Measurements in engineering, physics, and everyday tasks.
   - **Example**: The value of $\pi$ is used to calculate the circumference of a circle.

3. **Identifying and Using Prime Numbers**:
   - Cryptography relies heavily on large prime numbers for secure communication.
   - **Example**: RSA encryption algorithm.

### Summary

Understanding different types of numbers and their properties is foundational in mathematics. It enables students to tackle various problems, from simple arithmetic to complex equations, and prepares them for more advanced topics in algebra, calculus, and beyond. By mastering the use of directed numbers, natural numbers, integers, prime and composite numbers, and rational and irrational numbers, students can confidently apply these concepts in both academic and real-world scenarios.
