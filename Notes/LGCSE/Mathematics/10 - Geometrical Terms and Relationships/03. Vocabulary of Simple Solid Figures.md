### Vocabulary of Simple Solid Figures

Understanding and interpreting the vocabulary associated with simple solid figures is crucial in geometry. This section covers the essential terms and characteristics of various three-dimensional shapes, including cubes, cuboids, prisms, cylinders, pyramids, cones, and spheres.

#### Cube

A cube is a three-dimensional figure with six equal square faces, twelve equal edges, and eight vertices.

- **Face**: A flat surface of a solid. A cube has 6 square faces.
- **Edge**: A line segment where two faces meet. A cube has 12 equal edges.
- **Vertex (plural: vertices)**: A point where three edges meet. A cube has 8 vertices.

#### Cuboid

A cuboid is a three-dimensional figure with six rectangular faces, where opposite faces are equal.

- **Face**: A flat surface of a solid. A cuboid has 6 rectangular faces.
- **Edge**: A line segment where two faces meet. A cuboid has 12 edges.
- **Vertex (plural: vertices)**: A point where three edges meet. A cuboid has 8 vertices.

#### Prism

A prism is a solid object with two identical ends and flat faces. The cross-section along the length remains constant.

- **Base**: The two identical ends of a prism. The shape of the base determines the type of prism (e.g., triangular prism, rectangular prism).
- **Lateral Faces**: The faces that are not bases. They are parallelograms.
- **Height**: The perpendicular distance between the two bases.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder is a solid object with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface.

- **Base**: The two parallel circular ends.
- **Curved Surface**: The surface connecting the two bases.
- **Height**: The perpendicular distance between the bases.

#### Pyramid

A pyramid is a solid object with a polygonal base and triangular faces that meet at a common point called the apex.

- **Base**: The polygonal bottom face.
- **Apex**: The top point where all triangular faces meet.
- **Lateral Faces**: The triangular faces that connect the base to the apex.

#### Cone

A cone is a solid object with a circular base and a curved surface that tapers to a point called the apex.

- **Base**: The circular bottom face.
- **Apex**: The top point where the curved surface meets.
- **Height**: The perpendicular distance from the base to the apex.
- **Slant Height**: The distance from the base to the apex along the curved surface.

#### Sphere

A sphere is a perfectly round three-dimensional object where every point on the surface is equidistant from the center.

- **Radius**: The distance from the center of the sphere to any point on its surface.
- **Diameter**: Twice the radius, passing through the center of the sphere.
- **Surface Area**: The total area of the sphere's surface.
- **Volume**: The amount of space inside the sphere.

#### Interpreting the Vocabulary

1. **Cube**:
   - Recognize a cube by its equal square faces.
   - Example: A dice is a cube.

2. **Cuboid**:
   - Identify a cuboid by its rectangular faces.
   - Example: A shoebox is a cuboid.

3. **Prism**:
   - Determine the type of prism by its base shape.
   - Example: A triangular prism has a triangular base.

4. **Cylinder**:
   - Recognize a cylinder by its two parallel circular bases and curved surface.
   - Example: A soda can is a cylinder.

5. **Pyramid**:
   - Identify a pyramid by its polygonal base and triangular faces meeting at an apex.
   - Example: The Great Pyramid of Giza is a pyramid with a square base.

6. **Cone**:
   - Recognize a cone by its circular base and curved surface tapering to an apex.
   - Example: An ice cream cone is a cone.

7. **Sphere**:
   - Identify a sphere by its perfectly round shape.
   - Example: A basketball is a sphere.

#### Example Problems

1. **Identify the Solid**:
   - A solid has six equal square faces. Name the solid.
   - Solution: It is a cube.

2. **Find the Radius**:
   - The diameter of a sphere is 10 cm. Find the radius.
   - Solution: The radius is $\frac{10}{2} = 5$ cm.

3. **Calculate the Volume**:
   - A cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 10 cm. Calculate its volume.
   - Solution: Volume $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi \times 4^2 \times 10 = 160\pi$ cubic cm.

#### Practical Applications

- **Cubes and Cuboids**: Used in packing and constructing structures.
- **Prisms and Cylinders**: Important in designing containers and structural supports.
- **Pyramids and Cones**: Common in architecture and manufacturing.
- **Spheres**: Used in sports, manufacturing of spherical objects, and understanding planetary shapes.
