### Vocabulary of Triangles, Circles, and Special Quadrilaterals

Understanding the vocabulary associated with triangles, circles, and special quadrilaterals is fundamental in geometry. This section will cover the essential terms and their interpretations.

#### Triangles

A triangle is a three-sided polygon. Triangles can be classified based on their side lengths and angles.

**Types of Triangles by Sides**:
- **Equilateral Triangle**: All three sides are equal, and all three angles are 60°.
- **Isosceles Triangle**: Two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are equal.
- **Scalene Triangle**: All sides are of different lengths, and all angles are different.

**Types of Triangles by Angles**:
- **Acute Triangle**: All three angles are less than 90°.
- **Right Triangle**: One angle is exactly 90°.
- **Obtuse Triangle**: One angle is more than 90°.

#### Circles

A circle is a set of points in a plane that are all equidistant from a given point called the center. Important terms related to circles include:

- **Radius**: The distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle.
- **Diameter**: A chord that passes through the center of the circle; it is twice the radius.
- **Circumference**: The distance around the circle.
- **Chord**: A segment whose endpoints lie on the circle.
- **Arc**: A part of the circumference of a circle.
- **Sector**: A region bounded by two radii and an arc.
- **Tangent**: A line that touches the circle at exactly one point.
- **Secant**: A line that intersects the circle at two points.
- **Central Angle**: An angle whose vertex is the center of the circle and whose sides are radii.

#### Special Quadrilaterals

Quadrilaterals are four-sided polygons. Special quadrilaterals have specific properties:

- **Square**: All sides are equal, and all angles are right angles (90°).
- **Rectangle**: Opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles.
- **Rhombus**: All sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.
- **Parallelogram**: Opposite sides are parallel and equal, and opposite angles are equal.
- **Trapezium (or Trapezoid in the US)**: One pair of opposite sides is parallel.
- **Kite**: Two pairs of adjacent sides are equal, and one pair of opposite angles is equal.

#### Interpreting the Vocabulary

1. **Triangles**:
   - Identify and classify triangles based on their sides and angles.
   - Example: A triangle with sides 5 cm, 5 cm, and 8 cm is an isosceles triangle.

2. **Circles**:
   - Use terms to describe parts of the circle and their relationships.
   - Example: The radius of a circle is 7 cm, so its diameter is $2 \times 7 = 14$ cm.

3. **Special Quadrilaterals**:
   - Recognize and differentiate between various quadrilaterals based on their properties.
   - Example: A quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and one pair of parallel sides is a trapezium.

#### Example Problems

1. **Classify the Triangle**:
   - Given a triangle with angles 50°, 60°, and 70°, classify the triangle.
   - Solution: It is an acute triangle because all angles are less than 90°.

2. **Find the Radius**:
   - The circumference of a circle is 31.4 cm. Find the radius.
   - Solution: Use the formula $C = 2\pi r$.
     - $31.4 = 2 \times 3.14 \times r$
     - $r = \frac{31.4}{6.28} = 5$ cm

3. **Identify the Quadrilateral**:
   - A quadrilateral has all sides equal and all angles are right angles. Name the quadrilateral.
   - Solution: It is a square.

#### Practical Applications

- **Triangles**: Used in construction and engineering to create stable structures.
- **Circles**: Essential in understanding circular motion and calculating areas and volumes in real-life applications.
- **Special Quadrilaterals**: Important in design, architecture, and various fields of engineering.

By understanding and using the vocabulary of triangles, circles, and special quadrilaterals, students will be equipped to accurately describe and analyze geometric shapes and their properties.
