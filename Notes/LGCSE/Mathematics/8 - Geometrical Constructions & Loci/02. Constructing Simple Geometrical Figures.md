### Constructing Simple Geometrical Figures

Constructing geometrical figures accurately requires a good understanding of the use of a protractor, a set square, and a compass. Here, we will cover how to construct basic geometrical figures, angle bisectors, and perpendicular bisectors.

#### Basic Geometrical Constructions

**1. Constructing a Line Segment**

1. **Draw a line segment AB**: Use a ruler to draw a straight line segment AB of a specified length.
2. **Label the endpoints**: Mark the endpoints of the line segment as A and B.

**2. Constructing an Angle**

1. **Draw a base line**: Use a ruler to draw a straight line and label one endpoint as O.
2. **Place the protractor**: Align the midpoint of the protractor with point O.
3. **Mark the angle**: From the baseline, measure the required angle using the protractor and mark the point.
4. **Draw the angle**: Remove the protractor and use a ruler to draw a line from point O through the marked point, forming the desired angle.

**Example: Constructing a 60° Angle**

- Draw a base line and label one endpoint as O.
- Place the protractor on O, align it with the baseline, and mark the 60° point.
- Draw a line from O through the marked point.

#### Constructing Angle Bisectors

An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts.

1. **Draw the angle**: Draw an angle ∠AOB.
2. **Place the compass at the vertex**: Set the compass on point O and draw an arc that intersects both sides of the angle (at points C and D).
3. **Draw arcs from the intersections**: Without changing the compass width, draw arcs from points C and D. Let these arcs intersect at point E.
4. **Draw the bisector**: Draw a straight line from point O through point E. This line is the angle bisector.

**Example: Bisecting a 60° Angle**

- Draw ∠AOB = 60°.
- Place the compass at O, draw an arc intersecting OA at C and OB at D.
- Draw arcs from C and D intersecting at E.
- Draw line OE, which bisects ∠AOB.

#### Constructing Perpendicular Bisectors

A perpendicular bisector divides a line segment into two equal parts at a right angle.

1. **Draw the line segment**: Draw a line segment AB.
2. **Set the compass width**: Place the compass on A and set it to more than half the length of AB.
3. **Draw arcs above and below the line**: With the compass at A, draw arcs above and below the line. Repeat with the compass at B.
4. **Mark the intersections**: The arcs intersect at points C and D above and below the line segment.
5. **Draw the bisector**: Draw a straight line through points C and D. This is the perpendicular bisector of AB.

**Example: Constructing the Perpendicular Bisector of a Line Segment**

- Draw line segment AB.
- Place the compass at A and draw arcs above and below the line.
- Repeat from B, marking the intersections at C and D.
- Draw line CD, which is the perpendicular bisector of AB.

#### Practice Problems

1. Construct a 45° angle using a protractor.
2. Bisect a 90° angle.
3. Draw a perpendicular bisector for a line segment of length 6 cm.

By mastering these constructions, students will be equipped to handle various geometric tasks and understand the properties of geometric figures more deeply.
