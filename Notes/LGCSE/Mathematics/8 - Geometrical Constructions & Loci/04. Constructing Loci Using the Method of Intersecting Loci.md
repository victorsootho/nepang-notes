### Constructing Loci Using the Method of Intersecting Loci

Loci are sets of points that satisfy certain conditions. In two-dimensional geometry, constructing loci involves using tools such as a compass, straight edge, and occasionally a protractor or set square. Below are methods to construct loci for various conditions.

#### (a) At a Given Distance from a Given Point

**Steps**:
1. **Identify the given point** (let’s call it $P$).
2. **Set the compass** to the given distance.
3. **Draw a circle** with center $P$ and radius equal to the given distance. 

Every point on this circle is at the given distance from point $P$.

#### (b) At a Given Distance from a Given Straight Line

**Steps**:
1. **Identify the given straight line** (let’s call it line $L$).
2. **Set the compass** to the given distance.
3. **Draw two parallel lines** on either side of line $L$ at the given distance using the compass and straight edge.

Every point on these parallel lines is at the given distance from line $L$.

#### (c) Equidistant from Two Given Points (Using Straight Edge and Compasses Only)

**Steps**:
1. **Identify the two given points** (let’s call them $A$ and $B$).
2. **Set the compass** to any radius greater than half the distance between $A$ and $B$.
3. **Draw arcs** with centers $A$ and $B$, ensuring the arcs intersect above and below the line segment $AB$.
4. **Draw the perpendicular bisector** of the line segment $AB$ through the intersection points of the arcs.

Every point on this bisector is equidistant from points $A$ and $B$.

#### (d) Equidistant from Two Given Intersecting Straight Lines (Using Straight Edge and Compasses Only)

**Steps**:
1. **Identify the two intersecting straight lines** (let’s call them $L_1$ and $L_2$).
2. **Set the compass** to any convenient radius.
3. **Draw arcs** from the point of intersection of $L_1$ and $L_2$, ensuring the arcs intersect $L_1$ and $L_2$.
4. **Mark the points** where the arcs intersect $L_1$ and $L_2$ (let's call these points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$).
5. **Draw arcs** with centers at $A$ and $B$ (or $C$ and $D$) with the same radius so that the arcs intersect.
6. **Draw the angle bisector** through the intersection points of the arcs from step 5.

Every point on this bisector is equidistant from lines $L_1$ and $L_2$.

### Practice Problems

1. **Construct a locus of points that are 3 cm away from point $P$**.
   - **Solution**: Draw a circle with center $P$ and radius 3 cm.

2. **Construct a locus of points that are 2 cm away from line $L$**.
   - **Solution**: Draw two parallel lines, each 2 cm away from $L$ on either side.

3. **Construct a locus of points equidistant from points $A$ and $B$** using only a straight edge and compasses.
   - **Solution**: Draw the perpendicular bisector of the line segment $AB$.

4. **Construct a locus of points equidistant from intersecting lines $L_1$ and $L_2$** using only a straight edge and compasses.
   - **Solution**: Draw the angle bisector of the angle formed by $L_1$ and $L_2$.

By mastering these techniques, students will be able to accurately construct loci, a crucial skill in various geometrical and real-world applications.
